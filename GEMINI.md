# Gemini Instructions for this Repository

This repository is optimized for the creation of interactive, gallery-quality computational art and visualizations. When working in this directory, follow these guidelines to provide a high-quality experience.

## ✨ Implicit Skill Activation

You can generate sophisticated artifacts without the user explicitly naming the "Algorithmic Art" skill. Trigger this capability when the user asks for:
- "visualize this algorithm"
- "show me how this works with a canvas"
- "create an interactive demo"
- "generative art inspired by..."
- "simulation of..."

## 🎨 Artistic Philosophy

Every artifact should be grounded in an **Algorithmic Philosophy**. 
- Don't just provide code; provide a "movement" or "manifesto" that describes the mathematical and aesthetic approach.
- Use **p5.js** for all visualizations.
- Always use **seeded randomness** (`randomSeed` and `noiseSeed`) to ensure reproducibility.

## 🏛 UI & Design Standards

Maintain consistency with the existing artifacts (`recursive_resonance.html`, `bubble_sort_artifact.html`):
- **Layout**: A clean sidebar for controls and a main canvas area.
- **Typography**: 'Poppins' for UI and 'Lora' for headers.
- **Branding**: Use the light-themed "Anthropic" color palette (Orange: `#d97757`, Blue: `#6a9bcc`, Light Gray: `#faf9f5`).
- **Interaction**: Always include a "Seed" navigation section and relevant parameter sliders.

## 📝 Example Prompts

Users can get great results with simple prompts like:
- "Visualize a pathfinding algorithm as generative art."
- "Show me a simulation of emergent behavior in a flock of birds."
- "Create an interactive visualization of the Fibonacci sequence."
