# Skill-Generated Artifacts

This repository serves as a collection of interactive artifacts and visualizations generated using the **Gemini CLI** and the **Algorithmic Art** skill.

## 🎨 Overview

The files in this repository are self-contained HTML/JavaScript artifacts that utilize [p5.js](https://p5.js.org/) to visualize complex algorithms and computational concepts through a professional, interactive interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to view these artifacts is via the **Live Demos** linked below. 

Alternatively:
1. Clone this repository or download the specific `.html` file.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.

## 📂 Artifacts

### 1. Recursive Resonance
**[🔗 Live Demo](https://changtimwu.github.io/agent-skills-demo/recursive_resonance.html)**

A conceptual visualization of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process context.
- **File:** `recursive_resonance.html`
- **Concept:** Demonstrates that LLMs re-read the entire accumulated conversation history for every new inference.
- **Visuals:** Features a "top-down scan" effect during model turns, a pulsing "Inference Engine" to represent GPU load, and information flow particles.
- **Interaction:** A "Next Turn" button allows you to step through the conversation and observe the context accumulation process.

### 2. Algorithmic Order: Bubble Sort
**[🔗 Live Demo](https://changtimwu.github.io/agent-skills-demo/bubble_sort_artifact.html)**

A classic sorting algorithm visualized as generative art.
- **File:** `bubble_sort_artifact.html`
- **Concept:** Shows the emergence of structure from entropy.
- **Interaction:** Control the number of elements, the sorting speed, and customize the color palette for active vs. sorted states.

## 🛠 Built With

- **p5.js:** For the generative algorithms and rendering.
- **Anthropic Design Principles:** Professional UI with Poppins/Lora typography and specific color palettes.
- **Seeded Randomness:** Ensures that specific seeds always produce the same visual outcome for reproducibility.
